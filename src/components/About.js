          Observe and learn about the planets of the Solar System. Take the quiz
          and see how you stack up against others and your past high scores. If
          "Day Count" is enabled, each planet has a green number next to it
          representing the relative day lengths of each planet. One second is
          equal to 10 Earth days in the animation. Created with love by Michael
          Prieto.
